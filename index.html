  <h2>Week 1 (25th-29th Jan)</h2>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card">
      <h3> Monday </h3>
      <p>Started researching the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP), I started by reading the supplied documents on the competition to grasp an understanding of the EVRP. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card">
      <h3> Tuesday </h3>
      <p>I continued researching the EVRP and started to look at approaches to solve the EVRP; I started with the submissions to the EVRP competition.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card">
      <h3> Wednesday </h3>
      <p>Today I had a meeting with my dissertation supervisor, as well as continued research on EVRP approaches.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card">
      <h3> Thursday </h3>
      <p>With the guidance from my supervisor I chose two heuristic approaches to do further research and to start developing working approaches.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <div class="card">
      <h3> Friday </h3>
      <p>Finished the week by doing further research into the approaches I chose.</p>
    </div>

<h2>Week 2 (1st-5th Feb)</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Monday</h3>
    <p>I started the week by downloading the sample code supplied by the EVRP competition. Then I set up a github repository for the sample code and benchmark dataset.
    With the git setup I started to work on a python script to visualise the output of the EVRP sample code.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Tuesday</h3>
    <p>I finished developing the visualisation python script, it used matplotlib to plot the Depot, Charging Stations, Customers, and EV Paths.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Wednesday</h3>
    <p> Located an example C++ script for ant colonization optimization (ACO) which will act as a working example to base my ACO approach on.
    I also looked through the given sample code to grasp an understanding of how to develop a working approach. I also attended my weekly meeting where we discussed what to do next.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Thursday </h3>
    <p>To better understand the format of the heuristic needed for the sample code I started by developing two simple heuristics; the first using euclidean distance to determine which customer is next, and the second used Dijkstra algorithm to determine a path between customers.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Friday </h3>
    <p>Re-organised the sample code so that the heuristic.cpp could call different heuristics. I also continued developing the Euclidean heuristic and Dijkstra heuristic.</p>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Week 3 (8th-12th Feb)</h2>
<div class="row">
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Monday </h3>
    <p> Finished off the Euclidean and Dijkstra heuristic, these both showed marginal improvement upon the random heuristic supplied in the sample code.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column">
  <div class="card">
    <h3> Tuesday </h3>
    <p> I started implementing the ant colonization optimization algorithm as a heuristic using the example ACO script. The heuristic is currently implemented by doesn't function as intended. I also created my Dissertation Journal to note down my progress.</p>
